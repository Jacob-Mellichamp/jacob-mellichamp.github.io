			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>		
				I am Jacob Mellichamp, Founder of ProjectStar.
				Growing up in the Information-Age I was fascinated
				by electronics: phones, video games, and computers
				- and wanted to make sense of it all. This curiosity
				in electronics morphed into a passion for software
				engineering and network administration. I love and
				respect all aspects of computer science no matter
				the task, which is why <b> solving complex and
				meaningful solutions through software </b> is my
				purpose as a Computer Scientist.

					<h3>My passions</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Computer Science is a broad field with many topics. If I had all the time in the world believe me, I would love to learn them all. I am a firm believer that the future of technology will revolve heavily around cloud computing and Artifical Intelligence. As client software becomes more thin, datacenters and Software-as-a-Service products will have to pick up the burden of heavy work loads. These factors have influenced my decision to pursue the paths of Concurrent Programming, Network Programming, and Artifical Intelligence.</p>
